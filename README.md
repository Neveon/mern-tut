### How to run it
1. To run on desktop make sure to be in the `learn-mern` folder, `cd learn-mern` then `npm install`

2. Learned to integrate the `routes/api/items` folder into `server.js` for cleaner looking code and management
3. Learned how to use `axios` with `Redux` actions to easily obtain and/or dispatch data to reducers
4. Learned `reactstrap` to make clean responsive navbars, list groups and modals
5. Learned the use of `PropTypes` in `React` to type check data
